# Phillip Against The Road
This is the first videogame i have ever made (2016).
It was done using **GameMaker** with its own programming language called **GML**. The art of the game was made with a pixel art software called **Pixela** which allowed me to create 2D pixelart animations. In addition to that, i used some sounds to the game so it didn't feel too empty.
Unfortunatly i don't have the code i wrote, but at least i kept the ***.exe*** file.

## Gameplay
***Phillip*** must pick up the coins he droped from his way to the store. But he must be careful since the streets are full of cars and they won't stop at all. If he manages to pick up all the coins, he wins. But if he gets hit by a car, it's *game over!*.
